                <p> <b>Abstract</b> — Literacy has a broad definition across different
                fields. However it is an important topic in any area, but when it
                comes to visualization literacy, we cannot say it receives the same
                attention as text literacy. More specific in the data visualization,
                narrowing it down to bar charts, people’s literacy level is below
                the expected. Even though bar charts can be considered one of
                the simplest data visualization graphics and also one of the most
                common in our daily lives, people are usually not interested in
                improving their literacy level, what can cause misunderstanding
                and misinformation. The knowledge about building or reading
                a bar chart has been taken for granted when it should not.
                Regarding this issue, this project aims to develop a serious game
                that can teach people the meaning of each element in a bar
                chart (e.g., labels, axis, etc), also teach them how combine those
                elements in order to build a bar chart, at last the game will
                improve their capacity of interpret the bar chart visualization,
                in other words, improve their literacy level.
